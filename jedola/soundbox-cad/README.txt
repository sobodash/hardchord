Going through these, it should be apparent how things go together, despite the lack of lining.

All of these parts are made from the same 4mm thick wood. Whenever an angle must be cut on a piece, it's set 4mm in from the side, so that should make it easy to route/cut the angles on certain panel edges.

There is a copy of Panel C (which is the missing Panel E). There is also a copy of the Top (for the bottom).

I've included a layout of how the pieces should be cut from a single sheet measuring at least 1602 x 1331 x 4 mm. The grain of the wood should run lengthwise across the panels, or from left to right on the pdf.
